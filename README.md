# Leaflet.POJSO

**Under development and not even ready to be v0.0.1**
 
A subset of the great [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) library completely independent of browser objects.
BTW "POJSO" means plain old JavaScript objects. 

One could name it "Leaflet.headless", but this already exists: [leaflet-headless](https://github.com/jieter/leaflet-headless).
The difference? *Leaflet.POJSO* doesn't depend on [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) or some other browser mock.
But it only contains invisible objects like `LatLng`, `Bounds`, `Projection`, etc.

**I cannot give any guarantee that this project will be further developed! Maybe it's just a silly idea...**
